# Game Overview

The world is run by corporations which are competing to monopolize an industry. Players control a megacorp that can have subsidiaries across various industries.

# What is an industry?

An industry could be something like the Real Estate or Energy markets. These markets consume a resource (land, oil, etc) and produce a product (office space, energy).

# What does the board look like?

The board is a grid of "locations".  Each location may have resources needed for some industries.
Players use money to claim some or all of a resouce in a location. Based on the amount they are spending, they will get a corresponding amount of that resource every turn.

Each location is a unique market that will buy different products. The price and quantity of a product that a location purchases can change over time and can be influenced by players.
Put another way, each location has some maximum possible contribution to a player's market share. 
If the board's total market share is 100%, each location could be worth 10% or 20% depending on the location and industry. 

Locations also have a fee to unlock them, which enables a player to start operating in that location. (I think this fee should scale with the # of locations unlocked)

Idea: Locations are grouped and infer a bonus to a particular industry when controlled by a player.

# What is a monopoly? 

A monopoly is when a player has 100% market share in [all/one] [industries/industry]

Still need to work out if a player can potentially control all industries, either by buying out competitors or purchasing a controlling position in their stock.

# What does the game setup look like? (i.e. before the first turn)

Players choose their starting industry and start the game with some money and a small market share in their chosen industry in a [random?] location(s). 
This starting industry is just so that their market share starts above 0% for at least 1 industry, but they do not need to stick to this industry.

# What can a player do in their turn?

Each turn a player will collect their revenue less expenses. Then, a player can do any of the following:

- Unlock a new location
- Change the amount of a resource they are buying from a location
- Change the amount of a product they are selling to a location
- Trade resources or products with other players

# What can a player do when it's not their turn?

Real-time trading/speculating? TBD...

# How does a player lose?

A player loses when their market share in all industries is 0.

# How does a player win?

A player wins by either all other players losing or by achieving a monopoly, whichever happens first.

# How can players work together?

- Players can form partnerships and provide each other with resources/products at better than market rates.
- Players can make backroom deals/collude to sabotage 

# How can players compete?
prevent others from getting a monopoly
get a monopoly yourself

# What happens when a player loses?

They get a government job? TBD...

# What information is public? What is private?
Public:
- The list of locations and the resources in them
- Which players are in each location
- Players' market shares in each industry (debating on this being private)

Private:
- How much other players are spending on resources
- What trades players are making
- How much of a resource a player has (except money if I add the mechanic for a player to go public, which I think I will)
